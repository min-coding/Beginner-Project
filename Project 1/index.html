      <li><b> Brush Your Cat Every Day </b>
       <br><i>
  Brushing or combing your cat daily will cut down on the hairballs that can develop in the digestive tract. 
  Because cats spend so much time grooming themselves, some owners may not realize that brushing is something that can help their pet by removing loose hair. 
  Werber says that the key to getting a cat to cooperate with brushing is connecting brushing with happy events. 
  ″Maybe you always brush before a meal,″ he says. ″Then your cat will associate it with something delicious."

    <li><b> Don’t Feed Your Cat Too Much Dry Food </b>
       <br><i>
  Unlike dogs, cats cannot be vegetarians, even for short periods of time. 
  They rely on meat as the foundation of their diets, and the main meal of the day should always be meat, says Werber. 
  He cautions that exclusively feeding cats dry food diets may mean they consume too many carbs, which can be bad for cats in large amounts. 
  "We see cats developing Type 2 diabetes and growing obese from too much dry food," Werber explains. 
  If you own both dogs and cats, it can be tempting to treat them the same, but dog food is not good for cats, 
  nor can a cat's system tolerate carbohydrates the way a dog's system will.

   <li><b> Let Them Show Off! </b>
       <br><i>
  When a cat loves you, he or she wants to demonstrate it, sometimes by presenting you with the results of a successful hunt. 
  Werber suggests accepting the gifts with grace (even when sort of gross—hello, partially chewed mouse!). 
  Your pet will also show you love by head bumping, purring, or kneading you with his or her paws. Sit back and enjoy.
